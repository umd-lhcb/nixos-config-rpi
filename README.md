# nixos-config-rpi
NixOS configuration for Raspberry Pi used in burn-in. This branch works for rpi
4 only.


## Installation
Download the latest `NixOS` `aarch64` release from [1] (Yipeng's approved
images, preferred) or [2] (official, but experimental). Note that this is
officially termed as 'unstable', but should be sufficient in our case. This
branch can be used as a rolling release.

> This image relying on the raspberry pi foundation's kernel, and the raspberry
> pi foundation's boot chain, rather than our preferred u-boot based images using
> the mainline kernel.
>
> This specific image will not be kept for stable releases, and will be removed
> from Nixpkgs once a mainline-based u-boot-based generic image can boot on the
> raspberry pi 4.

Write the image to an SD card. In Linux, suppose we have a sdcard `mmcblk0`
with 2 partitions `mmcblk0p1` and `mmcblk0p1`, then we should write to
`mmcblk0`, **not** either of the partitions, with the following command:
```
sudo dd if=<nixos.img> of=/dev/mmcblk0
```

> On first boot, the rootfs will be automatically resized to use all available
> spaces of the SD card.

After the `dd` command is completed, mount the `/dev/mmcblk0p1` (the latter of
the two partitions) to `/mnt`:
```
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
```

Then clone the `rpi4` NixOS configuration:
```
cd /mnt  # Choose the correct mount path if differs
mkdir -p etc/nixos
cd etc/nixos
git init .
git remote add origin https://github.com/umd-lhcb/nixos-config-rpi
git fetch origin
git checkout rpi4
```

Then `umount` the SD card partition.

## System configuration
Plug the SD card into the rpi 4. Also attach monitor, keyboard, and internet. Since the rpis are not registered, the internet needs to be shared from another computer.

On first boot of the rpi, set the password of root with:
```
sudo passwd root
```
This password will then be overwritten by the configuration.

Then switch to root user:
```
su
```

We need to manually mount the boot partition first:
```
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot
```

Now we reconfigure the system with our settings:
```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

There might be some warnings and errors at this step. Ignore them. Reboot.
The user `lhcb` with `sudo` permission will be created in the process. Ask Yipeng/Manuel/Zishuo for the password.

Now we add the official `unstable` channel:
```
sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos
```

We can update the system with:
```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
```

If everything works, we can remove the old system generations with:
```
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
```
